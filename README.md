# joshkennedy-dot-me

This is an edited theme for [AnchorCMS](http://anchorcms.com) that I made for personal use.

See it in action [here](http://joshkennedy.me).

You're welcome to use it however you like.

### Things you'll probably want to change:

- Twitter username (found in `js/main.js`)
- Google Analytics code (found in `includes/header.php`)
- MediaTemple affiliate link - unless you'd like to help a brother out. Bills tp pay and whatnot. You can find that in `includes/footer.php`


This theme is still a WIP, so if something doesn't work, let me know.

### To-do:

- Add comments (Disqus? Facebook? Native?)
- Add [simple] portfolio
- Pull in links from [Lkd.to](http://lkd.to/)
