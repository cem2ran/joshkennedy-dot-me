### Things you'll probably want to change:

- Twitter username (found in `js/main.js`)
- Google Analytics code (found in `includes/header.php`)
- MediaTemple affiliate link - unless you'd like to help a brother out. Bills tp pay and whatnot. You can find that in `includes/footer.php`


This theme is still a WIP, so if something doesn't work, let me know.
