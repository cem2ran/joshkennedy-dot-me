### a lightweight theme for AnchorCMS

This is a theme for [AnchorCMS](http://anchorcms.com) that I made for personal use.

[See it in action](http://joshkennedy.me) or [download it](https://github.com/joshkennedy/joshkennedy-dot-me/zipball/master)

Have fun.

### Things you'll probably want to change:

- Twitter username (found in `js/main.js`)
- Google Analytics code (found in `includes/header.php`)
- MediaTemple affiliate link - unless you'd like to help a brother out. Bills to pay and whatnot. You can find that in `includes/footer.php`
- Disqus embed (found in `includes/comment_form.php`) [AnchorCMS comes with its own comments functionality, so you'll need to grab that from the default theme]
- Dribbble feed username - found in `includes/header.php`
